Tiles
=====

Tiles allows you to create beautiful hub pages with ease.


What's an Hub page?
------------------

An Hub page is a collection of data about you that you want to share with others.

For example an hub page might include an about section, something about your skills, where you live and what work you do, and don't forget about social networks, photos and books you readed recently.

Requirements
------------

* PHP 5.3 or newer


Installation
------------

Installing Tiles is easy as apple pie, copy all the content of the folder to your remote host and edit the configuration.php file to match your preferences.
